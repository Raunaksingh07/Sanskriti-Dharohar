      <p>
    The Ram Mandir (ISO: Rāma Maṁdira, lit. 'Rama Temple'), also known as Shri Ramlalla Mandir, is a partially constructed Hindu temple complex in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, India.Many Hindus believe that it is located at the site of Ram Janmabhoomi, the mythical birthplace of Rama, a principal deity of Hinduism.[8][9][10] The temple was inaugurated on 22 January 2024 after a prana pratishtha (consecration) ceremony. On the first day of its opening, following the consecration, the temple received a rush of over half a million visitors, and after a month, the number of daily visitors was reported to be between 100,000 and 150,000.

The site of the temple has been the subject of communal tensions between Hindus and Muslims in India, as it is the former location of the Babri Masjid, which was built between 1528 and 1529. Idols of Rama and Sita were placed in the mosque in 1949, before it was attacked and demolished in 1992. In 2019, the Supreme Court of India delivered the verdict to give the disputed land to Hindus for construction of a temple, while Muslims were given land nearby in Dhannipur in Ayodhya to construct a mosque. The court referenced a report from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as evidence suggesting the presence of a structure beneath the demolished Babri Masjid, that was found to be non-Islamic.

On 5 August 2020, the bhūmi pūjana (transl. ground breaking ceremony) for the commencement of the construction of Ram Mandir was performed by Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India.The temple complex, currently under construction, is being supervised by the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust. On 22 January 2024, Modi served as the Mukhya Yajamāna (transl. chief patron) of rituals for the event and performed the prāṇa pratiṣṭhā (transl. consecration) of the temple.[19][20] The prana pratishtha ceremony was organised by the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra.the temple has also attracted a number of controversies due to alleged misuse of donation, sidelining of its major activists, and politicisation of the temple by the Bharatiya Janata Party.

      <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">History</h2>
      <p>
     The site is the former location of the Babri Masjid, which was built in the 16th century. The mosque was attacked and demolished in 1992. In 2019, the Supreme Court of India delivered the verdict to give the disputed land to Hindus for the construction of a temple, while Muslims would be given land elsewhere to construct a mosque.

      <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Significance of Rama</h2>
      <p>
       Rama is a prominent Hindu deity who is regarded as a Pūrṇāvatāra (lit. 'complete avatar') of the God Vishnu.[c] and some Hindus view Rama as Para Brahman (lit. 'The ultimate Brahman'). Rama holds huge significance in Hindu culture and religion. In the Rama avatar, Vishnu is not supposed to exhibit any of his divine potencies and lead life as a human. As Rama is said to have possessed sixteen ideal qualities, Hindus view Rama as Puruṣottama (lit.'The ideal man'), Vigrahavān dharmaḥ (lit.'Embodiment of Dharma') and Ādi Puruṣa . According to the Hindu epic Ramayana, Rama was born in Ayodhya. Ayodhya is among seven most sacred cities to Hindus.
      </p>
      <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Pilgrim site</h2>
      <p>
       Three places in Ayodhya are considered as prominent puṇya kṣētra (lit. 'virtued pilgrimage site') by Hindus. They are Janmasthāna (lit. 'The birthplace'), Svargadvāra (lit. 'The gateway to Heaven') and Yajñasthala (lit. 'Place where holy sacrifice was performed'). There is a lack of consensus among scholars whether a temple at Ram Janmabhoomi was destroyed during medieval times.

The Trayōdaśakṣarī maṁtra (lit. '13-character mantra') also known as Śrī Rāma Tāraka Mantra (lit. 'The Rama mantra for Salvation') is Śrī Rāma Jaya Rāma Jaya Jaya Rāma and many Hindus believe that chanting it repeatedly lead to salvation.Tāraka means something that carries or helps a Jīva (lit. 'a living being') cross the ocean of samsara. Devotees of Rama such as Valmiki, Tulsidas, Bhadrachala Ramadasu, Samartha Ramadas, Tyagaraja, Purandara Dasa, Gondavalekar Maharaj and Mahatma Gandhi popularised this mantra.
      </p>

      <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Architecture</h2>
      <p>
    The original design for Ram Mandir was devised in 1988 by the Sompura family of Ahmedabad.[3] The Sompuras have contributed to the design of over 100 temples worldwide for at least 15 generations, including the Somnath temple.[76] The chief architect of the temple was Chandrakant Sompura, assisted by his two sons, Nikhil Sompura and Ashish Sompura, who are also architects.

A new design, with some changes from the original, was prepared by the Sompuras in 2020,per the Hindu texts, the Vastu shastra and the Shilpa shastras. The temple will be 250 feet (76 m) wide, 380 feet (120 m) long and 161 feet (49 m) high.[79] Upon completion, the temple complex became the world's third largest Hindu temple.It is designed in the Māru-Gurjara architecture of Nagara style, a type of Hindu temple architecture found primarily in northern India. A model of the proposed temple was showcased during the Prayag Kumbh Mela in 2019.

The temple's main structure has been built on a raised platform with three storeys. It has five mandapas in the middle of the garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum) and on the entrance passage. The Shri Ram Darbar, located on the first floor, comprises five halls – Nritya Mandap, Rang Mandap, Sabha Mandap, Prarthana Mandap, and Kirtan Mandap. In Nagara style, the mandapas are decorated with shikharas. Adorned with deity statues, the temple includes dedicated mandirs for Surya, Bhagwati, Ganesh, and Shiv at the corners. Annapurna and Hanuman temples are on the northern and southern arms. The foundation features a 14-metre (46 ft)-thick roller-compacted concrete layer resembling artificial rock, with a 21-foot (6.4 m) granite plinth for moisture protection, avoiding iron use. Accessibility is ensured with ramps, lifts, and facilities for the elderly and differently-abled. A pilgrims facility centre for 25,000 people offers medical and locker services. Environmental focus preserves 70% of the 70-acre (28 ha) area as green space, emphasising water conservation.

The temple has a total of 366 columns. The columns have 16 idols each to include the incarnations of Shiva, the 10 Dashavataras, the Chausath Yoginis, and the 12 incarnations of the goddess Saraswati. The width of the stairs are 16 feet (4.9 m). Per scriptures dedicated to the design of temples dedicated to Vishnu, the sanctum sanctorum is octagonal in shape.The temple covers an area of 4.0 hectares (10 acres), while the remaining 23 hectares (57 acres) of land has been developed into a complex with a prayer hall, a lecture hall, an educational facility and other facilities including a museum and a cafeteria.[50][additional citation(s) needed] According to the temple committee, the site has a capability to handle 70,000 visitors.[86] Larsen & Toubro offered to oversee the design and construction of the temple free of cost, and became the contractor of the project.[87][88] The Central Building Research Institute, National Geophysical Research Institute and the Bombay, Guwahati and Madras IITs have assisted in areas such as soil testing, concrete supply and design.

The construction work has been accomplished with 600,000 cubic feet (17,000 m3) of sandstone from Baansi in Rajasthan. No iron and steel has been used in the construction of the temple, and the fusing of the stone blocks has required ten thousand copper plates. In a culturally significant move, Thailand also symbolically contributed to the inauguration of the Ram Mandir, by sending soil to the Ram Janmabhoomi, building on their prior gesture of sending water from two rivers in Thailand to honour the temple.

According to the temple trust, the final blueprint of Ram Mandir included temples dedicated to Surya, Ganesha, Shiva, Durga, Vishnu and Brahma in the temple grounds.
      </p>
      <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Bhumi Pujan ceremony</h2>
    <p>
     On the occasion of Bhumi Pujan, the Ram Lalla's dress was stitched by tailors Bhagwat Prasad and Shankar Lal, a fourth generation tailor to Rama's idol.

The temple construction officially started again after a Bhumi-Pujan (transl. ground breaking ceremony) on 5 August 2020. The three-day long Vedic ritual was held ahead of the groundbreaking ceremony, which revolved around the installation of a 40 kg (88 pounds) silver brick as the foundation stone by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.[3] On the day before on 4 August, the Ramarchan Puja (transl. Puja of Rama's feet) was performed, in order to ritually invite all the major deities into the temple.

On the occasion of the Bhoomi Poojan, soil and holy water were collected from several religious places across India, such as the Triveni Sangam of the rivers Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati at Prayagraj, the head of the Kaveri river at Talakaveri in Karnataka, and the Kamakhya Temple in Assam. Soil was also sent from various Hindu temples, gurudwaras and Jain temples across the nation, as well as from the four pilgrimage sites in Char Dham, to bless the temple.

Before the ceremony, Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought Hanuman's blessing by praying at the Hanuman Garhi Temple in Ayodhya. The Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath, Chief of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Mohan Bhagwat, Chief of the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas and Chief of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra, Nritya Gopal Das and Narendra Modi gave speeches.

Some priests and religious leaders, such as Swaroopanand Saraswati, complained that 5 August was not a ritually auspicious date and that the ceremony did not follow proper ritual procedures. They also claimed that the function did not include a havan. Writer and activist Arundhati Roy, a noted critic of PM Modi, pointed out that the chosen date marked one year since the revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.The Pakistan Foreign Office issued a statement criticising India for commencing for constructing a temple on the former site of the destroyed Babri Masjid.[122]

In 2017, the Hindu Mahasabha accused the BJP, Bajrang Dal and other Sangh Parivar organisations of hijacking the Ram Mandir despite having no involvement in its long battle. In 2020, Pramod Joshi, the national spokesperson of the Hindu Mahasabha, said that the real credit of Ram Mandir belongs to Hindu Mahasabha, and that the Hindu Mahasabha should have performed the bhumi pujan, but instead had been kept away. He added that the committee for the temple was formed at the BJP's central office and the Hindu Mahasabha was sidelined.
