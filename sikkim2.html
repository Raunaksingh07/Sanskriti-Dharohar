      <p>
     According to the local legends, when Hanuman was flying to Dunagiri (mountain) which had the life saving herb Sanjeevani to save Lord Rama's brother Lakshmana, he rested in the spot for some time where his temple now lies.
      </p>

      <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">History</h2>
      <p>
       Legend has it that Hanuman Tok was the place where Lord Hanuman stopped to rest while carrying Sanjeevni to Lanka from the Himalayas. A long time back, people used to worship a stone that was present here, in the open, until Appaji Pant (who was an officer) built a statue of Lord Hanuman in the 1950s after he had a dream about this sacred place. It is believed that all wishes get fulfilled at Hanuman Tok which attracts lots of locals as well as tourist pilgrims from all over the country. In 1968, this area was given to the Indian army, and since then it is maintained as well as preserved by the army.
