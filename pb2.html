The gods afraid that the Lord’s anger would destroy the universe sought the assistance of Lord Vishnu who dispatched his all-powerful discus – Sudarshan Chakra – to cut Sati’s body into pieces.  Every spot that received a portion of Maa Sati’s body became in the ages that followed a place of worship for devotees of the Goddess. Each of these spots is honoured as a Shakti Peetha by devotees of the Goddess who are also referred to as Shaktas.
